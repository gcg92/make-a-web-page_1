      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
<p>
  The wolrd wide web is a colleciton of HTML documents, which is the main document type on the web. <em>In addition</em> to HTML, the following file types can be found on the web:<br><br>
  -<b>Images<br>
  -Video<br>
  -Plain text<br>
  -Music</b>
        </p>
        <p>
  HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language." This is the basis for every web page. HTML documents contain text content (what you see), markup (what it looks like), references to other documents, and links to other pages.<a href="www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48230539/m-48742046">This video</a> is a good place to start.

  <h3>How the Web Works</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
  <p>
  First, let's define the <em>major pieces</em> of the web:<br><br>
  -Servers - Computers that host the files that make up the web<br>
  -Internet - world's largest computer nerwork<br>
  -Browser - program that displays files on your computer from the web<br>
  -HTTP - the main protocol used by browsers to communicate with servers
      </p>
      <p>
  The browser on your computer and makes requests to servers via the internet using the HTTP protocol. The servers respond with files that your browser displays. <a href="www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48329854/m-48480">Here's a good explanation.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
  HTML markup is made up "tags." Tags look something like this:
  &lt;Tag name&gt; Contents &lt;/Tag name&gt;<br><br>
  The two tag names are always the same, while the first one is called the <em>opening</em> tag and the second is called the <em>closing</em> tag.
  The opening tag, its contents, and the closing tag as a whole can be referred to as an <b>element</b>. HTML tags are used to help the browser identify the type of each element.You can find an introduction of the two <a href="www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444">here</a>

  <h3>Computers Are Stupid?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-description">
  <p>
    It's important to remember that computers interpret the instructions humans give them <em>literally</em>. One small typo or mistake that  "smart" human could correct can lead to huge problems when given to a computer. What do you think happens when you forget to insert a closing tag?

  <h3>Inline vs. Block Elements</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-description">
  <p>
    You may notice that text on multiple lines will appear on a single line when written in HTML. 
  Tags such as &lt;br&gt; and &lt;p&gt; can aid in creating line breaks. The <b>break</b> tag is an inline element that signifies the end of a line. The <b>paragraph</b> tag is a block element that creates an invisible box around its contents. <a href="www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723438">This</a> video is a big help.

  <p>
  <b>- Web Page</b> - text doc written in HTML. Web browsers read these docs, interpret, and display them.<br>
  <b>- Coding</b> - writing text in a language the computer can understand.<br>
  <b>- Computers are stupid</b> - You must write exactly the way the computer understands (syntax)<br>
  <b>- Tags</b> - w/in brackets: opening, closing, void<br>
  <b> - Element</b> - everything w/in a tag<br>
  <b> - Attribute</b> - the property of an HTML element

     HTML elements can be either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around their contents.

  <h3>The Tree-Like Structure of HTML</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-description">
  <p>
  <em>First</em>, let's start with some basic definitions:<br><br>
  <b>- HTML</b> - HyperText Markup Language - the standard markup language used to create web pages.<br><br>
  <b>- CSS</b> - Cascading Style Sheets - style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.<br><br>
  <b>- DOM</b> - Document Object Model - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages).
    </p>
    <p>
  This "tree like" structure comes from the fact that HTML elements can contain other elements inside of them. In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes, which can be drawn out like a family tree.

 <h3>HTML and Boxes</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-description">
 <p>
  Every HTML element is inside an "invisible box." When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.

  <h3>Text Editors (For Programming)</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-description">
  <p>
  What is a text editor? A text editor is a program that helps you type text similar to document editors, such as Microsoft Word or Corel WordPerfect, but without all the extra formatting functions that document editors have.
    </p>
    <p>
  When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text). These make their lives easier by doing things like automatically generating closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.

    <h3>CSS - Search and Replace</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p>
      CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" and is used to control the style of HTML elements. It can also be thought of as a search and replace tool. First, you identify a <b>tag</b> or <b>class</b> of the element you want to find. Then, you decide what you want to do with it, or what property values to replace with different ones.
    </p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="concept">
    <div class="concept-title">
    <h3>Cascading</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p>
      "Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect. This gives programmers an efficient way to control the style of related HTML elements.

      <h3>Avoiding Repetition</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        In computer programming, it would be easy to repeat yourself over and over if you didn't know better. This repetition is not only time consuming, but can lead to systemic errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often times you will find yourself writing the same code over and over with only minor differences. For example, how are you going to apply the same style attributes to all elements of a certain type? You could always copy that style and paste it each place that element occurs within your code, but that still leaves a lot of room for error. If you decide to alter the style of a certain element and forget to make that change everywhere, you're in trouble. Remember, computers are stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
        An easy method for avoiding repetition is through the use of the <b>div</b> element. By assigning similar divs the same <b>class</b>, you can specify the style for that class just once and be done. This also allows you to quickly change the style of that class whenever you want and be sure that the change is made everywhere!

    <h3>Order Matters</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p>
      It also matters where you define the rules and in what order they are applied. Styles can be defined in different places and are applied in the following order:
      <br><br>
      <b>1)</b> the default style of a browser (different browsers have different styles<br>
      <b>2)</b> 	stylesheet in a separate file<br>
      <b>3)</b> 	stylesheet inside HTML<br>
      <b>4)</b> 	inline style in an element - this should be avoided

    <h3>How to Include CSS On Your Webpage</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p>
      There are three ways to achieve this:<br><br>
      <b>1)</b> For small projects, you can write CSS in the &lt;head&gt; element of your HTML<br>
      <b>2)</b> Link your HTML to a separate CSS file	<br>
      <b>3)</b> Write your style inline with your HTML, which leads to a lot of repetition

    <h3>Boxes and Sizing</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p>
      All HTML elements are boxes made up of four components: content, padding, border, and margin. It can be difficult to get the size of each component just right.
      </p>
      <p>
      One way to size boxes is by using percentages, where the size of each box changes as the screen size changes. If you want the size of the box to remain unchanged, use pixels. You can also set a max width for each box, so it gets smaller if necessary, but never exceeds a given size.
